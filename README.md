Wheat spike development is tightly regulated by genetic and metabolic programs that drive organ growth and morphological changes. However, the dynamic interplay between metabolic shifts, gene expression patterns, and their regulatory roles during spike development remains poorly characterized.
To address this gap, we performed integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling across 12 developmental stages of wheat spike organs. Our analysis detected 1,105 metabolites in 233 spike, spikelet, and floret samples, uncovering an uneven distribution of hormone-related metabolites. The exogenous hormone treatment experiments provided further confirmation of phytohormones' regulatory roles in spike morphogenesis.
